This is a simple blog built using Hugo with the "Terminal" theme.

## Getting Started

To get started with your Hugo blog, follow these steps:

1. **Install Hugo**: Make sure you have Hugo installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installation/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-hugo-blog.git
   cd my-hugo-blog
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**: Start the Hugo server to view your blog locally.

   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:1313` to see your blog in action.

## Creating New Posts

To create a new blog post, use the following command:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
